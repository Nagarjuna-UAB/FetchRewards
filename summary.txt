1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I used Node.js to develop this application. It's easy to start development of the project. Easily large number of
libraries using node package manager (npm). Also, It's been one widely used technology to develop the back-end 
applications. Used the file system library to read the files in our local system. Even though we are having so many 
libraries to parse the CSV file. I used 'csv-parser' because, we can easily get the data in the array of objects format.
and also size of the package is also less compared to other packages.


2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

The advantages of my solution apart from the fetching the correct output is showing the messages when we got an error
providing the arguments,providing the wrong file, more than available points are provided. For easy understanding
have been written the code in different functions. 
The disadvantages is we iterating over the data multiple times. May be we can reduce this. As we are using the hashMap
and to display the in object format we have to iterate over hashMap again.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?

My favorite project is Home Automation application. It's about controlling home electrical devices using mobile 
application. The challenge i faced while developing is fetching the data from the electrical device and updating
in the application based on the frequent change.
